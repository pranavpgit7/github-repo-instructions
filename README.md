Next time, when you forget the commands, you don't have to spend more than 5 minutes looking for a video on YouTube. You're welcome.

Instructions:

To add your code files from the "codes" folder on your desktop to your GitHub repository named "github-repo-instructions" using Git Bash, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Git Bash: Go to the Start menu, search for "Git Bash," and click on it to open the Git Bash terminal.

2. Change directory: Use the `cd` command to navigate to your "codes" folder on the desktop. For example, if your username is "YourUsername," you can use the following command:
   ```
   cd /c/Users/YourUsername/Desktop/codes
   ```

3. Initialize a Git repository: If the "codes" folder is not already a Git repository, you need to initialize it by running the following command:
   ```
   git init
   ```

4. Add files to the repository: Use the `git add` command to add all the files in the "codes" folder to the repository:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

5. Commit the changes: Create a commit to save the changes you made. Use the `git commit` command with a descriptive message to commit the files. For example:
   ```
   git commit -m "Add my code files"
   ```

6. Connect to your GitHub repository: You need to set up a remote connection to your GitHub repository. If you haven't done so already, create a new repository on GitHub named "github-repo-instructions."

   In the Git Bash terminal, run the following command, replacing `<username>` with your GitHub username and `<repository>` with the repository name:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/github-repo-instructions.git
   ```

7. Push the changes to GitHub: Finally, use the `git push` command to upload your code files to the GitHub repository:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   Note: If you already have files in the repository and you are pushing for the first time, you might need to use `git push -u origin master` instead of `main`.

After executing these steps, your code files from the "codes" folder on your desktop will be added to your GitHub repository named "github-repo-instructions."


If you have already added the files to the Git repository using the `git add` command, you can proceed to commit and push those changes to the remote repository using the following commands:

1. Commit the changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

   The `-m` option is used to provide a commit message that describes the changes you made.

2. Push the changes to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

   Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to push the changes to. Typically, the default branch is `master` or `main`.

Here's an example workflow:

1. Add the files to the Git repository:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

   This command adds all the changes in the current directory to the staging area.

2. Commit the changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Added new feature"
   ```

   This creates a new commit with the specified message.

3. Push the changes to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push origin master
   ```

   This command pushes the committed changes to the `master` branch of the remote repository.

Note: If you haven't previously set up the remote repository or configured the upstream branch, you may need to use additional commands to set those up. Let me know if you need assistance with that as well.
